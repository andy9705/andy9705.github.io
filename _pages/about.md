Hi! I am a Ph.D student at [Seoul National University](http://milab.snu.ac.kr). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Kyomin Jung](http://milab.snu.ac.kr/kjung/index.html). I aim to develop AI systems that are both beneficial and safe for society. To achieve this, I am focusing on:

(1) Enabling LLMs to understand and interact across multiple modalities (Multimodal LLMs),

(2) Enhancing decoding control for more reliable and precise responses,

(3) Exploring multi-agent systems to enable dynamic and collaborative AI interactions.
