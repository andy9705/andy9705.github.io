Hi, I am Ph.D. student at Seoul National University, advised by Prof. Kyomin Jung. I aim to develop AI systems that are both beneficial and safe for society. To achieve this, I am focusing on:
(1) Enhancing decoding control for more reliable and precise outputs,
(2) Exploring multi-agent systems, such as debating agents, to enable dynamic and collaborative AI interactions.
