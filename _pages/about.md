Hi, I am Ph.D. student at Seoul National University, advised by Prof. Kyomin Jung. I aim to develop AI systems that are both beneficial and safe for society. To achieve this, I am focusing on:

(1) Enhancing decoding control for more reliable and precise response,

(2) Exploring multi-agent systems to enable dynamic and collaborative AI interactions.
