    abstract = "The goal of DSTC11 track 5 is to build task-oriented dialogue systems that can effectively utilize external knowledge sources such as FAQs and reviews. This year{'}s challenge differs from previous ones as it includes subjective knowledge snippets and requires multiple snippets for a single turn. We propose a pipeline system for the challenge focusing on entity tracking, knowledge selection and response generation. Specifically, we devise a novel heuristic to ensemble the outputs from the rule-based method and neural model for entity tracking and knowledge selection. We also leverage metadata information in the knowledge source to handle fine-grained user queries. Our approach achieved the first place in objective evaluation and the third place in human evaluation of DSTC11 track 5.",
